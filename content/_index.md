description: > 
    Droidian is a GNU/Linux distribution based on top of Mobian, a Debian-based distribution for mobile devices. The goal of Droidian is to be able to run Mobian on Android phones. <br />
    <br/> 
    This is accomplished by using well-known technologies such as libhybris and <a href="https://halium.org/" target="_blank">Halium</a>. <br />
    <br/> 
    Note that this is a downstream Mobian derivative, please report bugs and support requests at us, see below for contact details.
