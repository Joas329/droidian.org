Hello world, 

as you might have noticed in the last few days, we changed the name of our GitHub organizations. And we also have a cool [new website](https://droidian.org)!

hybris-mobian was born with the objective to port the goodness of [Mobian](https://mobian-project.org) to Android devices.

We think that we have always been pretty clear on who we are and what our affiliation with upstream Mobian is, nevertheless people kept asking for support for our project on their official channels.

As a result, Mobian asked us to add a more prominent disclaimer both on our GitHub organization and on our website, but we quickly got to the conclusion that renaming the project would be the best course of action.

We have been laying low until most basic features are working (and we're near there!), but should our project become more popular in the future, we feel that our website won't become the main entry point for many people looking to get Mobian installed on their Android device, thus bypassing disclaimers and links to our support channels.

We took the radical approach - a new name, **Droidian**. It's shorter, composed by a single word and better conveys what we're trying to do: running Debian on Android devices. Plus, it's also a play on the [Droidian Slip](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Droidian%20Slip). :smile:

We hope you'll like the new name as we do. Stay tuned for more details on what we've been working on these last few weeks and, if you want, join us on [Telegram](https://t.me/droidian), [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#droidian:matrix.org) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/droidianlinux)
